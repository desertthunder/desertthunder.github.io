# Owais Jamil's Portfolio: desertthunder.github.io

This is [my](https://linkedin.com/in/owais-jamil) portfolio website. It is built
with a modified version of the Ed [theme](https://gohugo-theme-ed.netlify.app)
for Hugo, which itself is a port of the Lanyon [theme](https://lanyon.getpoole.com),
used by [Minimal Computing](https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/). I chose it due to
its emphasis on written content.

## Notes

Deployments are handled through Github actions.

Removed this from default_foot:

```html
{{ template "_internal/google_analytics_async.html" . }}
```
