## Intro

Hey there! My moniker here is Desert Thunder, but usually I go by Owais. I'm a software
engineer with roots in New England and Austin, TX. Right now I'm enrolled as a master's
candidate at the University of Texas, and most recently worked as a senior backend engineer
at [Edlink](https://ed.link/).

### Mission

The purpose of this site is for me to give back to the software engineering and computer
science communities. There are a lot of tools, information, and resources out there,
many of them freely available. They've been paramount to my transition from the
natural sciences in to engineering (I double majored in microbiology and biochemistry).
As I've been learning new technologies and concepts, I've taken a lot of notes and
would like to [share](https://desertthunder.github.io/garden/) publicly. Additionally,
I would like to dabble in teaching and have essays posted to help expose readers
to complex topics.

I'd like to add that there will be some posts and notes about mental health and personal
development. The best engineers in my experience are the ones who live fulfilling
lives. I've seen it. I was raised by one of those engineers.

Learning is fun. Engineering is supposed to be fun. I hope my work here helps you
enjoy what you're doing!

### Current Work

Right now I'm deepening my understanding of Linux, design patterns (shout out
to uncle bob), and software [architecture](https://cosmicpython.com/).
To supplement this, I've been learning Golang and C++ to augment my knowledge of
the dynamically typed languages I've used for much of my career
(Python, Ruby, and JavaScript).

Some projects I'm working on include a mental health application with Django, and
some CLI and TUI tools with Python (rich and textual) and Golang (Bubbletea).

### Future

In the future I'd like to learn functional programming concepts and native iOS development
with Swift. Charm, the company behind Bubbletea, has exposed me to Elm architecture.
This led me to Gleam, and my work with Rails showed me Elixir and Phoenix.

### Hobbies

Outside of programming, I love to read, lift weights, and watch Dodger baseball.
It has been a blast hearing the ball come off of Shohei Ohtani's bat at the ravine
every night. I like to read all kinds of books. Right now I'm reading the first
of Henry Rollins' Black Coffee Blues trilogy, as well as A Psalm for the Wild Built.

### Inspiration

- Khan Academy
- Every version of CS50
- Kent C. Dodds
- ThePrimeagen
