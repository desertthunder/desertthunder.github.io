# Welcome

Hey there! My moniker here is Desert Thunder, but usually I go by Owais.
I'm a software engineer with roots in New England and Austin, TX.
Right now I'm enrolled as a master's candidate at the University of Texas, and
was most recently working as a senior backend engineer at [Edlink](https://ed.link/).

## Mission

The purpose of this site is for me to give back to the software engineering and computer
science communities. There are a lot of tools, information, and resources out there,
many of them freely available. They've been paramount to my transition from the
natural sciences in to engineering (I double majored in microbiology and biochemistry).
As I've been learning new technologies and concepts, I've taken a lot of notes and
would like to [share](https://desertthunder.github.io/garden/) publicly. Additionally,
I would like to dabble in teaching and have essays posted to help expose readers
to complex topics.
